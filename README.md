enigma machine project

This is project 0 of my Data Structures course. Coding, debugging, and meeting style standards took approximately 15
hours. I created all .java files with the exception of PermutationData.java, which contains default settings 
provided by the professor. The project specifications are included as a .pdf file.

If the course instructors have any concerns about my sharing of this code
on a public domain, please let me know and I will make the appropiate changes!

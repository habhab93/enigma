This is project 0 of my Data Structures course. Coding, debugging, and meeting style standards 
took approximately 15 hours. My code received full credit.

Future iterations would include elimination of unnecessary methods and better commenting of variables and methods.

I created all .java files with the exception of PermutationData.java, which contains default settings 
provided by the professor. The project specifications are included as a .pdf file.

If the course instructors have any concerns about my sharing of this code
on a public domain, please let me know and I will make the appropiate changes!
